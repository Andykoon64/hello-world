I am a full-time student attending CSU Monterey Bay majoring in Computer Science with a focus in network security. I expect to graduate by Spring 2022. I also currently work as a PET Lab technician at Supplies and Solutions.

I'm very interested in Networking. What makes computers connect and why do these connections work the way they do? One day i'd like to design large scale networks for new companies.
